#Cat Fight
##What Happened?
I have ceased development on the ‘Cat Fight’ game. Its purpose was to dive right into making a game in JavaScript and solving any roadblocks I ran into. The process was fun and the lessons I’ve learned will be immensely useful in future projects.
Unfortunately, one of the things I’ve learned is the importance of clean code and a thorough design before going into construction. The game is plagued with instances of poor code that would require complete reconstruction of mechanics. This happened because, too often, I changed my mind about the direction of the game. I understand this is a problem with many projects and is referred to as "feature creep". I don't believe the code is THAT horrible but I'd much rather move on and create something new :) Perhaps I might revisit this idea some day!

##Story
You are a cat. The dog is not your friend. Scratch it up and avoid getting hit! Move with arrows.
